This is just a quick&dirty app for reviewing our video footage. Don't try this at home.

Importing videos:

    cd videos/
    Dir['**/*'].each do |file|
      Video.create!(filename: file)
    end

User setup:

Set a JSON string in ENV[USERS] with names/passwords, e.g.:

    {"joe":"pass","jane":"asdfgh"}
